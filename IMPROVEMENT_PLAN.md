encase lined up units with a thin red border units can slowly share health if they are in a line. so the center doesnt colappse. 

make the units run from battle if their health is less than ten percent, and the unit fighting them has more than triple their health.
unless they have commander bonus.

the "no supply" morale penalty only takes effect if the supply bar is depleted.

buy a commander.

idle units should face the enemy influence direction


hills should have three levels and mountains should be the fourth level

units should have a ranged attack, that has a range of three squares and does half damage and have a different attacking animation (puff of smoke)

make units contruct a bridge instead of the current behavior in water, this fills in the space with road but is very slow.



add a slider for base unit damage per second in the debug controls menu
make a slider for supplied unit healing speed

make a new key "r" for retreat make sure to add it to the controls menu.  if pressed on a slected unit it moves back one space.
additionally if the backwards direction is blocked search other blocks prioritizing close cells aligned with the backward direunitction

remove the code for unit hold "h"
remove the code that makes units advance so that they can automatcially engage units on the diagonal
