Framework: Phaser 3 (Local Development)
Task: Create a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) for a top-down, real-time tactical simulation.
Project Structure:
Set up a standard local web project structure (e.g., assuming a main.js and an index.html).
Do not use CDNs. Assume Phaser 3 is installed locally via npm or available in the local project folder.
Functional Requirements:
The Map: Initialize a Phaser Scene with a green background.
The Unit:
Create a class for a "Unit" that renders as a simple 2D block.
The unit should have a "selected" state (boolean).
Input Logic:
Selection: Implement logic to detect clicks on the block to select it.
Command: If a unit is selected, clicking on an empty area of the map must set a destination.
Movement:
The unit should move toward the destination in real-time.
Let the AI determine the most efficient Phaser-native way to handle the movement (e.g., Velocity-based or Tween-based).
The unit should stop once it reaches the target.
Technical Preference:
Use clean, modular JavaScript or TypeScript.
Implement a simple state check to ensure "Selection" and "Movement commands" don't conflict (i.e., clicking the unit to select it shouldn't also trigger a move command to that same spot).

Use TypeScript. Leverage strict typing to ensure you maintains a consistent understanding of the Unit class and Phaser 3 API
